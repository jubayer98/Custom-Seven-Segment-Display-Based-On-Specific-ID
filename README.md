# Custom Seven Segment Display Based On Specific ID

This repository contains a custom seven-segment display designed to print a specific ID. The project is created using a simulation tool called Logisim, which is excellent for simulating digital logic circuits. You can modify the display to suit your own purposes.

## Description

A seven-segment display is an electronic display device that displays decimal numerals and some alphabets. This custom seven-segment display project is configured to show a specific ID. It can be easily modified to display different IDs or other characters as needed.

## Tools and Requirements

- **Logisim:** A graphical tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits.
  - Download and install Logisim from the [official website](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/).

## Features

- Customizable display to show specific IDs.
- Easy to modify for different purposes.
- Simulated using Logisim for accurate digital logic circuit representation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Logisim installed on your system.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jubayer98/Custom-Seven-Segment-Display-Based-On-Specific-ID.git
   cd Custom-Seven-Segment-Display-Based-On-Specific-ID
   ```

2. **Open in Logisim:**
   - Launch Logisim.
   - Open the project file (`custom_seven_segment_display.circ`) in Logisim.

## Usage

1. **Simulation:**
   - Once the project is open in Logisim, you can start the simulation by clicking on the "Simulate" menu and selecting "Ticks Enabled".
   - The seven-segment display will show the specific ID configured in the project.

2. **Customization:**
   - To modify the ID displayed, edit the connections and logic gates in Logisim to represent the desired segments for each digit.
   - Save the changes and run the simulation to see the updated display.
